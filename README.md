In this project, I explored the famous Iris dataset to understand the differences between three types of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The main goal was to build a simple machine learning model that can correctly identify the species of a flower based on its physical measurements.

he Iris dataset is a well-known collection of flower data with 150 rows. Each flower is described by four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Steps -

Loaded the dataset using Pythonâ€™s Seaborn library.

Looked at the data with some basic summaries and visualizations to see how the flowers differ.

Built a logistic regression model to classify the species. As it was a catagorical data so I choose logistic regression model

Tested the model and was happy to see it got everything right with 100% accuracy!
